# Performance and Data Analytics Fixes

This document summarizes the improvements made to fix performance issues and API errors in the GMB (Google My Business) data sync process.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DIRECTION_REQUESTS Invalid Metric Error ✅
**Problem**: The GMB API was returning a 400 error for `DIRECTION_REQUESTS` metric in multi-daily metrics calls.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `DIRECTION_REQUESTS` from the default metrics array
- Added intelligent retry logic that detects invalid metrics and retries without them
- Updated error handling to gracefully handle 400 errors with specific metric validation

### 2. Permission Denied (403) Errors ✅
**Problem**: Many GMB API endpoints return 403 errors for accounts without special permissions.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling to treat 403 errors as expected for standard accounts
- Added informative logging that explains these errors are common and not critical
- Implemented graceful fallbacks that continue processing other data

### 3. Database Save Failures ✅
**Problem**: Database operations could fail without proper retry mechanisms or error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff for database operations
- Implemented timeout handling for hanging database requests
- Added duplicate key error handling with intelligent upsert strategies
- Enhanced error logging with specific error messages

### 4. Poor Error Logging ✅
**Problem**: Error messages were generic and not user-friendly.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive error classification system (`GmbErrorHandler`)
- Added structured error logging with severity levels and categories
- Implemented user-friendly error messages that explain common issues
- Added context-aware error handling for different operation types

### 5. API Fallback Mechanisms ✅
**Problem**: When primary API endpoints failed, the entire sync process could fail.

**Solution**:
- Implemented multi-tier fallback system for insights API
- Added alternative data fetching approaches when primary methods fail
- Created minimal data objects to ensure consistency even when APIs are unavailable
- Enhanced search keywords parsing to handle different response formats

## Key Improvements

### New Error Handler Utility
Created `lib/utils/error-handler.ts` with:
- Intelligent error classification (API, database, network, validation)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- User-friendly error messages
- Severity-based logging with appropriate emojis

### Enhanced Retry Mechanisms
- **Database Operations**: 3 retries with exponential backoff
- **API Calls**: Intelligent retry based on error type
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeouts with retry on timeout
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with backoff on 429 errors

### Improved Data Consistency
- Always return minimal data objects instead of null/undefined
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Progressive sync continues even if individual operations fail
- Better duplicate handling in database operations

### Better Search Keywords Handling
- Support for multiple API response formats
- Handles both `monthlySearchCounts` and `insightsValue` formats
- Proper parsing of threshold values vs actual counts
- Fallback to zero values when data is unavailable

### Enhanced Logging
- Structured logging with context and severity
- Progress indicators with retry information
- User-friendly status messages
- Detailed error context for debugging

## API Error Handling Matrix

| Error Code | Category | Retryable | Action |
|------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 400 | Bad Request | No* | Parse error, retry without invalid params |
| 401 | Unauthorized | No | Log authentication issue |
| 403 | Permission Denied | No | Log as expected, continue |
| 404 | Not Found | No | Log as API unavailable, continue |
| 408 | Request Timeout | Yes | Retry with backoff |
| 429 | Rate Limited | Yes | Retry with exponential backoff |
| 500-504 | Server Error | Yes | Retry with backoff |

*400 errors are retryable only for specific cases like invalid metrics

## Performance Improvements

1. **Parallel Processing**: Error handling doesn't block other operations
2. **Smart Retries**: Only retry operations that have a chance of success
3. **Timeout Management**: Prevent hanging requests from blocking sync
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Use streaming responses and progressive saves
5. **Database Optimization**: Upsert operations to handle duplicates efficiently

## Monitoring and Debugging

- Enhanced console logging with emojis and severity indicators
- Structured error objects with full context
- Progress tracking with retry information
- User-friendly status messages in sync responses

## Result

The sync process is now much more robust and handles the common GMB API limitations gracefully. Users will see:
- Fewer failed syncs due to API limitations
- Better progress information during sync
- More informative error messages
- Consistent data even when some APIs are unavailable
- Automatic recovery from transient errors

All improvements maintain backward compatibility and don't affect the existing data structures.
